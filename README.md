# DingPics

World of Warcraft add-on to automatically screenshot with time played when you level up.

By default the screenshot is triggered 300ms after the PLAYER_LEVEL_UP event for optimal view of the yellow animation. You can adjust this in DingShot.lua if you want.

## Install

Download the folder and extract in `BattleNet\World of Warcraft\_classic_\Interface\AddOns`. Make sure the folder is called `DingShot` and not `DingShot-master`.
